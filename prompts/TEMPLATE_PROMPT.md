# GitHub Copilot Prompt for README.md Generation

## Instructions for Copilot:
Using the provided files and examples, generate a complete `README.md` for this analysis.
Inside the `README.md` there are some concepts and idea that I want to include.
Ensure that the readibility and profesionalism of the text is top class.

## Context:
- Each analysis folder contains an analysis of a specific experiment, feature, or dataset.
- A `README.md` should summarize the analysis scope, objectives, and key findings.
- Examples of well-structured `README.md` files exist in other analysis folders.

## Guidelines:
1. **Use the existing content** in the `README.md` as a starting point.
2. **Follow best practices**, ensuring clarity, conciseness, and well-structured sections.
3. **Include**:
   - **Title**: Reflect the analysis name.
   - **Summary**: Briefly describe the purpose, main questions, and context.
   - **References**: Link to relevant documents (PIDs, Confluence, Figma, dashboards).
   - **Key Visuals**: If applicable, reference images in the `assets/` folder.

- Do not and extra sections besides the ones mentioned above.
